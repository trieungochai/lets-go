By default, every response that your handlers send has the HTTP status code 200 OK (which indicates to the user that their request was received and processed successfully), plus 3 automatic system-generated headers: a `Date header`, and the `Content-Length` and  `Content-Type` of the response body.

```
$ curl -i localhost:4000/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 18 Mar 2024 11:29:23 GMT
Content-Length: 21
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

### Status code constants
The `net/http` package provides [constants for HTTP status codes](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#pkg-constants), which we can use instead of writing the status code number ourselves. Using these constants is good practice because it helps prevent mistakes due to typos, and it can also help make your code clearer and self-documenting especially when dealing with less-commonly-used status codes.

### Customizing headers
You can also customize the HTTP headers sent to a user by changing the response header map. Probably the most common thing youâ€™ll want to do is include an additional header in the map, which you can do using the `w.Header().Add()` method.
